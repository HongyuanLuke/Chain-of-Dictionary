We are keeping updating this repository. For now, we provides sample code in this repository to translate from GPT baselines.

Here are some useful resources:
FLORES-200 dataset: https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores/blob/main/flores200/README.md
NLLB translator that can be used to create dictionaries: https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-3.3B
